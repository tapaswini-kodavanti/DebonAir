# DebonAir

## Inspiration
Air pollution affects every global citizen all over the world. Despite this, there are very few resources curated towards kids on informing them about the dangers of air pollution. Moreover, children with asthma are likely to ask questions on why more polluted areas irritate them more than other cleaner areas. To answer these questions and promote cleaner air, DebonAir promotes a cleaner environment through the spread of knowledge.

## What it does
DebonAir is an online platform that provides real-time data on current air quality standards. After entering your latitude and longitude, the user can see statistics on how clean the air that they are breathing is. If it is not too clean, the website will give information on staying inside and avoiding certain areas. There are also many areas of learning (geared towards children) and further research.

## How we built it
DebonAir was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Challenges we ran into
I had trouble with formatting the information section of the website. There were many components to balance, but planning ahead allowed me to avoid difficult obstacles in the first place. Additionally, the website is having issues with accessing the data through the Open Weather API (used in this project). Future iterations will overcome this obstacle and provide a public resource free of charge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud of the professional look of the website. Through meticulous planning, the website looks clean and is very user friendly.

## What we learned
I learned a lot about using APIs in Javascript and will continue to do a lot of research on how to properly implement API features.

What's next for DebonAir
I plan on continuing my research on Javascript APIs and implement them in the near future. I would like to tranfer the program to use a Flask program so that there can be a database stored on the backend of the website.
